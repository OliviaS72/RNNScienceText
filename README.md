# RNNScienceText
A **recurrent neural network** to classify text as relating to "Biology", "Chemistry", or "Physics".
This project uses a Kaggle dataset that can be found at this link:

**There are a total of 10,281 comments in this dataset, with each one relating to either the field of physics, chemistry or biology. The goal of classification is to accurately predict the field that the comments pertain to. The training data consists of 8,695 comments, and the testing data consists of 1,586 comments. Extra symbols, punctuation, and spaces will be removed as part of the cleaning process. Also, stop words will be removed and stemming will occur to simplify words down to their roots.**
